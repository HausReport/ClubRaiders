Trade and turning in exploration data help a *station's controlling faction*.
Completing a mission helps whichever faction gives the mission. 

###Trade
Current thinking is that trading a mix of cargoes affects influence more than a single cargo.  For example selling 750 doodads
at once might equate to an inf+ mission, whereas selling a load of 150 apples, 150 banannas, 150 canteloupes, 150 dates, and 150 eggplants might equate to completing an
inf+++++ mission.  The influence goes to the controlling faction of the station where the goods are sold at a profit.

###Exploration
Current thinking is selling exploration data in batches of 4 million credits is an effective way to generate influence for a station's controlling faction.  An excellent
way to make quick money exploring is by use of of the "Road to Riches" tool at http://edtools.ddns.net/expl.php.  The dashboard tool at https://www.edsm.net/ can be used to
make a good estimate of the current value of exploration data you have on board.

###Missions
The influence given for completing a mission ranges from inf+ to inf+++++.
Failing a mission is thought to have no effect on influence.
