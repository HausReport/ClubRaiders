Group play is recommended for larger projects.  It's believed that there are hidden
daily caps that we don't understand, and there are subtle "points of diminishing returns"
throughout the Background Simulation system.

Wing play is also useful.  Activities like trading, bounty hunting, running missions, and warfighting have their influence multiplied
when players are in wings.  For example, if a wing of 3 players earns a bounty, and each
redeems it properly, the influence effect is tripled.
