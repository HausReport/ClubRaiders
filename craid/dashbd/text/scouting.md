We use the term **scouting** to mean gathering data on systems with Club activities.

The easiest way to scout a system is to visit it while running an EDDN updating system, like EDDI or ED:
Market Connector.  A list of these tools is available at the [EDDN Player Tools list](https://github.com/EDSM-NET/EDDN/wiki#player-tools).

Another approach is to enter the data manually on EDDB.  This can make sense if you've visited a system before and can
access influence information in the system map via the galaxy map.  Near the bottom of the EDDB page, look for the
phrase "Read the FAQ and Fix it on ROSS!"

The table below should be sorted by the "Scouted" column, to show you what systems haven't been updated in a long time.
