Bounty hunting improves the influence of a system's *controlling faction.*  Bounty hunting in club-controlled systems isn't
helpful to our goals, but in systems where they're present but not controlling, it can be very effective.  Turning in a bounty
at an Interstellar Factor negates most or all of the effect.

We have a lot of information on which systems have ringed planets.  Most systems with ringed planets have
resource extraction sites (RES) and many of these have hazardous RES.  We have no reliable information about Compromised Navigation Beacons.  We know that Hazardous Resource Extraction Sites (Haz-RES) are 
very common in systems with refinery and extraction economies.  

Current thinking is that redeeming bounties in batches of over 200,000 credits provides
the best results.  Thus ten batches of 200,000 credits will affect influence much more than one batch of
2,000,000 credits.
