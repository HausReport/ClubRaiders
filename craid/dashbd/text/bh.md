Bounty Hunting
==============

Bounty hunting improves the influence of a system's *controlling faction.*  Bounty hunting in club-controlled systems isn't
helpful to our goals, but in systems where they're present but not controlling, it can be very effective.  Turning in a bounty
at an Interstellar Factor negates most or all of the effect.

We have no reliable information about Compromised Navigation Beacons.  We know that Hazardous Resource Extraction Sites (Haz-RES) are 
very common in systems with refinery and extraction economies.  Almost every system that has a ringed planet will have resource
extraction sites: viewing the system in https://eddb.io can help you plan.
