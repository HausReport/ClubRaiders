Like wars, elections last 7 days and the first side to win 4 days wins.  The winner
gets an influence bump of around 5 points, and the loser loses around 5 points.

Trade and turning in exploration data help a *station's controlling faction*.
Completing a mission helps whichever faction gives the mission.  

Bounty hunting apparently doesn't help sway elections.  It's unclear whether piracy, murder, and
smuggling have an effect or not.
