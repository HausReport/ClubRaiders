The scouting data tells us which systems are in *war* or *civil war* states, and thus should have combat zones.  

War and civil war states last from 4 to 7 days.  The first side to win 4 days wins the war.  Fighting against a club faction in a war is an effective way to reduce
their influence.  Turn in your combat bonds at a local station (not an interstellar factor).  Winning a low-intensity zone
is worth inf++, a medium zone is inf+++, and a high zone is inf+++++.  We think that optional objectives award additional
points.

Before making a long trip, make sure to check the last time the system was scouted.  If you've visited that system before, you can check
that wars are still in progress using the system map via the galaxy map.  A good resource (if the system has been scouted
recently) is the [Elite Background Simulation App](https://elitebgs.app/).
