Selling mined minerals, like trade in general, helps a *station's controlling faction*.

Mining against The Club is an interesting way to fight the background war.
Remember that selling 5 types of material is worth more influence than selling
1 type, even if that one type is much more profitable.  Also, mining multiple minerals
can be much faster than just one.

We think the profit-influence transaction cap is linked to the system's population.  For
most systems, selling 10 low temperature diamonds probably grants as much influence as selling
128 of them.  However, selling 10 low temperature diamonds, and 5 other batches of mined materials
probably grants more influence than selling 120 LTDs.

The mineral price prediction algorithm is still in testing.  Be sure to check prices and
demand before investing a lot of time mining.
