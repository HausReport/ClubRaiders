You can use the difficulty score, based on influence and population, to help find a 
suitable system to attack.  Systems with a difficulty of 1.0 or less are good 
environments to learn the BGS.  Look for systems that support the activities you're
interested in doing - whether that be running missions, fighting in war zones, bounty
hunting or whatever else sounds fun.

Systems with difficulty between 1 and 100 would take increasingly more skill, luck, and time for
a single commander.  Difficulties over 50 would represent a significant effort for one commander
and should be left for experts desiring a real challenge or groups.
