Following a datacenter anomoly at Pavlou Keep on Maia B-1d, a number of materials were found identifying
factions working to expand the influence of the shadowy organization known as ***The Club.***  A group of historians, diplomats, combat pilots, and data scientists have been working for weeks to digest the information
and make it accessible to individual commanders and squadrons who want to join the fight against The Club. The primary goal of this ***Club Raiders*** project is to "identify, engage, and eradicate" factions that support The Club.

Almost always, if a faction is operating outside its home system and its influence is kept below 2.5%,  it will retreat from the system, decreasing The Club's 
galactic influence.  In a very few cases, factions are apparently immune to the retreat mechanism.
