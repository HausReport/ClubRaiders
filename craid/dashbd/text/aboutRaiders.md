## FAQ

1. Tell me about the program.
    * It's open-source, written in Python using Plotly's Dash framework. 
    The source code is available at https://github.com/HausReport/ClubRaiders.
1. I want to discuss an issue.
    * Shortly, there will be a forum thread on Frontier Development's web site.  In the meantime,
    discussion is mostly taking place on Discord.
1. I want to change some text.
    * There are two ways: one is to get added to the project on Github and the second is to talk
    to someone who is added to the project on Github.  You can join Github here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account
1. Numbers should be formatted better.
    * This depends on a bug fix in Dash.
1. Colors and fonts should be more elite-y.
    * Again, this depends on a bug fix in Dash.  About 95% of the site can be made to look elitey at the moment,
    but the items that can't make the whole thing look ridiculous.
1. I have a better sort query/filter query for an activity or want to add a new activity.
    * This sort of issue can be expressed on the channels in #2 above.  There's plenty of room for tweaking and improvements.
1. How do you identify club-related minor factions?
    * They were identified by [The Children of Raxxla](https://inara.cz/squadron/4980/) in [The Holdstock Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPw1EzRmor2TvRw97QvB8lNTcBT2XffrMuMwEOAXaW8/edit?usp=sharing).

1. How about player minor factions?
    * They are explicitly filtered out of consideration.  We had one case where a player minor faction
    wasn't identified as such on http://eddb.io.  In that case, someone should fix the faction on Eddb and
    changes will be reflected here in a day or so.
