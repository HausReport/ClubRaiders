Trade and turning in exploration data help a *station's controlling faction*.

Current thinking is that trading a mix of cargoes affects influence more than a single cargo.  For example selling 750 doodads
at once might equate to an inf+ mission, whereas selling a load of 150 apples, 150 banannas, 150 canteloupes, 150 dates, and 150 eggplants might equate to completing an
inf+++++ mission.  The influence goes to the controlling faction of the station where the goods are sold at a profit.
